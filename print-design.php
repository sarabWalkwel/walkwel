                        </small></h3>

                        <p>Design is just as much about yielding an emotional experience as it is presenting the visual itself. Quality print design should conjure up a human response in your audience - getting them to think, learn, or feel about a certain topic. However, a significant amount of design planning must take place in order for the end product to trigger an emotional response in its audience. When it comes to quality print design, the designer should allocate just as much time planning the design concept of branded print materials as they do in actually creating the completed design.</p>

                    </small></h3>

                    <p>Print designs that are cluttered can be disorienting, confusing, and can yield disconnect between your brand's print materials and your audience. Simple layouts that reflect your simple and concise messaging are more likely to catch the viewer's eye - the goal of any good print advertisement.

                            Uses Clear Copy

                        </small></h3>

                        <p>When writing copy-heavy print content, it is important to keep in mind that large blocks of copy can be difficult for viewers to fully digest and are often ignored. Use of single lines of copy or bullet points will encourage readers to read all the information your print materials are presenting to them. When using copy, it is also important to remember how the font or typeface will relate to any graphics that might also be present in your content. Avoid placing text over busy images that can make the text illegible for your audience.

                    </small></h3>

                    <p>Just like any good advertisement, print design should focus on the benefits that your customer will get from your product or service. Keep the messaging simple while keeping in mind what will appeal to your target customers and remember that ultimately the only reason people are reading your print design material is because they are looking to know what benefits you offer. This is true with both branded content like business brochures and trade show displays as well personal print design content like business cards.</p>
