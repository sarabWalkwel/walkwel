                    <p>Responsive web designs use CSS queries to figure out what device the website is being viewed on. It will then use this information to adjust itself accordingly, ensuring that it is optimized for viewing on a specific screen size. Using responsive web design, developers can create single websites to serve all kinds of devices, from desktop computers to laptops, digital tablets and smartphones.</p>

                    <p>Now that iPhones, iPads and other Apple devices come with retina displays, there has been a trend in responsive web designs featuring retina support. By incorporating retina support into responsive web designs, users can benefit from crystal clear images and text. This is definitely a trend which designers should consider following as it is likely that most future devices will have retina displays, making them an influential factor in web design.<br><br>
